### [+] Description
In my 3rd semester, I led a collaborative project in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with two of my classmates, where we developed an engaging number guessing game using Java. The project provided an excellent opportunity to apply core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in a practical setting. By effectively managing the team and coordinating tasks, we successfully created a fun and interactive game that not only solidified our understanding of Java but also strengthened our teamwork and problem-solving skills.

### [+] Installation
 - `Download the Project: Download the ZIP file from the GitHub repository and extract it to your desired location.`
 - `Open the Project in an IDE: Open your Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.) and select the NUMBER GUESSING.iml file or the main project folder.`
 - `Set Up JDK: Ensure your IDE is configured with the correct Java Development Kit (JDK) version required for the project.`
 - `Run the Application: Locate the main method in the src folder, right-click on it, and select Run 'main' to start the game.`

### [+] Usage
 - `OOP Learning: Grasp core OOP concepts in action.`
 - `Number Guessing Fun: Test your guessing skills!`
